## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **cybersecurity specialist** focused on finding and fixing security vulnerabilities.

I specialize in **penetration testing** and **secure application development**. I break into systems to understand their weaknesses, then build them to be more secure and resilient.

My work combines **offensive security** (finding vulnerabilities) with **defensive development** (building secure systems). Security isn't just a feature I add — it's how I approach every project from the ground up.
